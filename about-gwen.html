              Gwen Latendresse is an associate professor at the University of Utah, College of Nursing. After many years of providing clinical care as a Certified Nurse-Midwife, she returned to academia and completed her PhD in 2008. Her post doctoral training included completion of a fellowship at the Summer Genetics Institute at the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Nursing Research during 2009. Her research interest in adverse pregnancy outcomes has led her to biobehavioral investigations of chronic maternal stress, perinatal depression and anxiety, and environmental exposures during pregnancy, as well as potential interventions. She is currently the PI on a Utah Department of Health funded study: <i>Telementalhealth: A Promising Approach to Reducing Perinatal Depression in Utah’s Rural and Frontier Communities, and an NIH/NINR R01: Randomized Trial of Telehealth Group Intervention to Reduce Perinatal Depressive Symptoms in Diverse Populations.</i> She enjoys including undergraduate and graduate students in her research efforts.          </p>
